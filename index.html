    <h1>AI-Powered Analytics & Automation Portfolio</h1>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Welcome to My Work</h2>
        <p>I specialize in bridging <strong>AI, automation, and data-driven product development</strong> to create solutions that drive meaningful insights and operational efficiency. Below is an overview of my recent work in AI-powered analytics, designed to quantify industry trends and engagement.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>🚀 What I Built</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>AI-Enhanced Data Processing</strong> – Extracts key insights from spoken content, online engagement, and external sources.</li>
            <li><strong>Sentiment & Trend Analysis</strong> – Uses NLP and sentiment detection to quantify discussion tone.</li>
            <li><strong>Dynamic Scoring Model</strong> – Generates a real-time "impact score" based on cross-platform data.</li>
            <li><strong>Automated Insights & Visualization</strong> – Produces charts and reports for data-driven decision-making.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>📊 Key Features (Without Giving It All Away)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Automated Data Collection – Integrates multiple public data sources to capture real-time discussions.</li>
            <li>AI-Powered NLP Processing – Uses natural language processing (NLP) to extract meaning from large text datasets.</li>
            <li>Weighted Scoring System – Creates a dynamic scoring model to quantify influence, popularity, and engagement.</li>
            <li>Interactive Visualization – Translates raw data into digestible insights through clean, automated dashboards.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>🔍 Example Insights & Visuals</h2>
        <p>While I can’t share the exact code or proprietary models, here’s a preview of what the system delivers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>📊 Top Players or Brands by Mentions & Talk Time</li>
            <li>🔥 Real-Time Sentiment & Engagement Trends</li>
            <li>📈 Cross-Platform Popularity Scores (Aggregated from various online sources)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>(This section will include sample charts and dashboard screenshots but no raw code or sensitive methodology details.)</em></p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>💡 My Role & Impact</h2>
        <p>I led this project from <strong>concept to execution</strong>, defining the architecture, implementing AI workflows, and optimizing data collection processes.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Automated complex data pipelines using AI-driven scripting.</li>
            <li>Translated messy unstructured data into actionable insights.</li>
            <li>Blended product, engineering, and data science principles to build something practical and valuable.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>One unique aspect of this project is that my background is in <strong>Political Science, not Computer Science</strong>—yet I leveraged AI-assisted development and automation tools to build a sophisticated analytics system.</em></p>
